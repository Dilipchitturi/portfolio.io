        <h2>E-commerce Website</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my web development journey, I designed and developed an E-commerce website from scratch. The website
            offers a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products. It includes features like product
            categories, search functionality, shopping cart, and secure payment gateways.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies to create a
            fully functional and responsive E-commerce platform. Through this project, I honed my skills in front-end design,
            data handling, and server-side development.

        <h2>Home Automation System</h2>
        <p>
            In pursuit of my interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), I developed a Home Automation System that allows users
            to control various home appliances remotely. The system integrates sensors, actuators, and a central control unit
            to automate tasks such as controlling lights, fans, and appliances.
        </p>
        <p>
            I implemented the system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and I utilized Python programming for communication and
            data processing. This project helped me understand the practical applications of IoT and its potential to enhance
            convenience and energy efficiency in modern homes.

        <h2>Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            The development of communication technologies and e-commerce has made the credit card the most common technique
            of payment for both online and regular purchases. However, this popularity also attracts fraudulent transactions
            in credit card data transactions, which are increasing each year.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I explored the use of machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent credit card fraud. By
            analyzing historical credit card transaction data and employing various machine learning techniques, I developed
            a fraud detection model that can precisely and efficiently identify fraudulent transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project allowed me to delve into the fascinating field of machine learning and its applications in tackling
            real-world challenges like fraud detection. I gained valuable insights into data preprocessing, feature engineering,
            and model evaluation, which are essential skills for a data scientist or machine learning practitioner.
